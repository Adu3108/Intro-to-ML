# Week-1
In this week we will primarily focus on learning the libraries that we will be using in our programs a lot.

## Libraries
1. [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)

   This library is used for working majorly with arrays and matrices or working in the domain of linear algebra. 
   
2. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html)
   This library is a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis
   
3. [Scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/)
   As the name suggests, this library is used for scientific and technical computing
