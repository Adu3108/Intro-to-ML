# Week-3
In this week, we focus on some unsupervised learning algorithms and in particular clustering algorithms. We introduced K-Means clustering algorithm.

## Assignment

The assignment focuses on implementing K-Means clustering algorithm using the basic Python libraries NumPy and Pandas. In addition to this, we also explore the cases when K-Means is not able to effectively cluster the dataset.
